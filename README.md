# Periodic-Table

The periodic table is a graphical representation of the chemical elements, organized on the basis of their atomic number, electron configurations, and chemical properties. The elements are arranged in rows and columns, with each element being represented by a unique chemical symbol. The table also provides information about the element's atomic weight, electron configuration, and chemical properties. The elements in the periodic table are grouped into categories, such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, based on their chemical and physical properties. The periodic table is a useful tool for understanding the chemical behavior of elements and their compounds.

<h1>INTRODUCTION </h1>

The periodic table is a fundamental tool in the field of chemistry, providing a visual representation of the chemical elements and their properties. The elements are arranged in rows and columns, with each element being represented by a unique chemical symbol. The table also provides information about the element's atomic weight, electron configuration, and chemical properties.

The elements in the periodic table are arranged in order of increasing atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom. This arrangement reflects the gradual filling of the electron shells in the atoms of the elements. This arrangement is called "periodic" because the properties of the elements repeat themselves in regular intervals.

The elements in the periodic table are grouped into categories, such as metals, nonmetals, and metalloids, based on their chemical and physical properties. Metals are characterized by their high electrical conductivity, high melting and boiling points, and malleability. They are typically found on the left side of the table. Nonmetals, on the other hand, are characterized by low electrical conductivity, low melting and boiling points, and poor malleability. They are typically found on the right side of the table. Metalloids, which have properties intermediate between those of metals and nonmetals, are typically found along the stair-step line that separates the metals from the nonmetals.

The periodic table is also useful for understanding the chemical behavior of elements and their compounds. For example, elements in the same group (column) of the table have similar chemical properties, and elements in the same period (row) have similar electron configurations. This allows for predictions about the behavior of elements and their compounds, and it also facilitates the discovery of new elements and compounds.

In conclusion, the periodic table is a vital tool for understanding the chemical elements and their properties. It provides a way to organize and understand the chemical behavior of elements and their compounds, and it facilitates the discovery of new elements and compounds. The periodic table is an essential tool for chemists and other scientists, and it continues to be an important part of the study of chemistry today.


<h3> Information On the Project how hyperlinks are used to Show Periodic Table</h3>

* An interactive periodic table with HTML info would include hyperlinks that allow users to access additional information about each element by clicking on its chemical symbol. These hyperlinks can be programmed to direct the user to a specific webpage or section of the website that provides more in-depth information about the element, such as its atomic structure, physical properties, and chemical properties.

* The information presented on these webpage can be in HTML format, which is a markup language used to create and structure web pages. HTML elements such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links can be used to organize and present the information in a clear and easy-to-understand format. It's also possible to use CSS and JavaScript in conjunction with HTML to make the interactive table more dynamic and user-friendly.

* An interactive periodic table with HTML info can be a valuable resource for students, educators, and researchers in the field of chemistry and other sciences. It can also be useful for anyone who wants to learn more about the elements and their properties.
